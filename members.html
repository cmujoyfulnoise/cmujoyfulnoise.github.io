She likes to sing phrases randomly, enjoys all sorts of pies, appreciates spending rainy days inside (with friends and good music), cares about people, and relishes golden hour, the hour(s) of day when the earth is bathed in golden sunshine as the day sinks into the night. Above and before all these things though, she is a follower of Christ and invites you to come follow Him as well.</p>
