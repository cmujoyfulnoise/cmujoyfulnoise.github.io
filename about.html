            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            <p>Joyful Noise is a Christian a cappella singing group currently composed of students from Carnegie Mellon University. It is open to any university student by audition; in the past members have hailed from the University of Pittsburgh, the Community College of Allegheny County, and of course CMU. The group was formed in October 1993 for the purpose of glorifying God through music, singing a cappella songs in styles ranging from hymns to popular songs. In addition, we use alternate media to convey God&#39;s love and speak about the joy of a relationship with Christ.</p>
            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <em>To share the truth and the joy of the gospel through music.</em>
            <p>While this is a simple sentiment, we feel that it conveys what we are about. We are not just a Christian group, nor just an a cappella group, but rather both, and we seek to use this fact to its fullest potential.</p>
