			<h1>Who we are</h1>
			<p>
				Joyful Noise is a Christian a cappella singing group currently composed
				of students from Carnegie Mellon University. It is open to any
				university student by audition; in the past members have hailed from the
				University of Pittsburgh, the Community College of Allegheny County, and
				of course CMU. The group was formed in October 1993 for the purpose of
				glorifying God through music, singing a cappella songs in styles ranging
				from hymns to popular songs. In addition, we use alternate media to
				convey God&#39;s love and speak about the joy of a relationship with
				Christ.
			</p>
			<h1>Our Mission</h1>
			<em>To share the truth and the joy of the gospel through music.</em>
			<p>
				While this is a simple sentiment, we feel that it conveys what we are
				about. We are not just a Christian group, nor just an a cappella group,
				but rather both, and we seek to use this fact to its fullest potential.
