                    <p>Alina is an IS sophomore with a creaky old body and a mentality of a 5 year old. She is most known for bursting into strange noises, shrieking random song lyrics, and burping. Very gassy.</p>
                    <p>Her goal in life is to touch everyone around her with the truth and love of Christ, whether it's through music, schoolwork, or strange quirks.</p>

                    <p>2 Corinthians 12:9</p>
                    <p>Hello! I’m just a meme-loving leetle daughter of God who enjoys embarrassing her friends with strange dance moves and eats lots of good fewd.  My hobbies are writing, analyzing movies and books, studying chemistry and medical science, running, and roasting people/being roasted. My life was changed by Christ when I was a sophomore in high school, and ever since, I hope that everything I do is centered in Him and for His glory. I am just a sinner in need of grace finding refuge in God’s love, finding joy in lifting up noise to Him (heh).</p>
